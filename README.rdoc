The **Redmine Selectize Plugin** is an extension for Redmine that enhances the user experience when interacting with `select` fields (dropdowns) by integrating the powerful **Selectize** library. Selectize provides advanced dropdown functionalities, including search, autocomplete, and multi-select capabilities, improving usability and efficiency.

With this plugin, all `select` tags in Redmine are automatically converted into modern, searchable, and dynamic dropdowns, making it easier to navigate long lists and select multiple options where applicable.
