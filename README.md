# Redmine Select2 Plugin

## Description

The **Redmine Select2 Plugin** is an extension for Redmine that enhances the user experience when interacting with `select` fields (dropdowns) by integrating the popular **Select2** plugin. Select2 is a library that transforms dropdown menus into more dynamic, searchable, and multi-select elements.

With this plugin, all `select` tags in Redmine are automatically converted into advanced dropdowns with search functionality, autocomplete support, and multi-select capability where applicable.

## Features

- **Quick Search:** `select` fields now include a search bar, making it easier to select options in long lists.
- **Multi-Select:** Allows selecting multiple options from a dropdown when supported.
- **Improved User Experience:** Dropdowns are more modern, with customizable styles.
- **Redmine Compatibility:** The plugin integrates seamlessly with Redmine and adapts to its interfaces.

   - Clone the repository into the `plugins` folder of Redmine:

     ```

2. **Run the database migration (if needed):**
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Restart Redmine** to apply the changes.
